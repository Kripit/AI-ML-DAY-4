# üçî Food Classification using YOLOv8 (Pretrained)

This project focuses on building a **production-grade food image classifier** using the **YOLOv8 classification head** (`yolov8n-cls.pt`, `yolov8s-cls.pt`, `yolov11n.pt`), fine-tuned on a subset of the **Food-101 dataset**.

Currently, we are using **5 classes**:
- `pizza`
- `grilled_chicken`
- `sushi`
- `ice_cream`
- `hamburger`

The classifier is designed to be **fast**, **lightweight**, and **highly accurate**, suitable for real-time applications.
